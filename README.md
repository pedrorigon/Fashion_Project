# Fashion Project

### The Static WebSite (HTML5, CSS3)

<p>This project is a fashion website called "New Fashion Everything Never Enough" with several sections such as portfolio,
about us, contact, and gallery. The site is responsive, uses meta tags for SEO, utilizes CSS for styling, and has an embedded Google Maps section.
Based on the CSS code provided, it seems like the "Project Fashion" website has a modern and sleek design with a focus on fashion and sustainability.
The website has a white background with a fixed width of 1024px and a margin of 20px on all sides.
The header has a dark blue background color and includes the brand name and a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website. 
The navigation links have uppercase letters, letter-spacing, and a hover effect that changes the text color.
The Portfolio section has a centered heading and paragraph that provide an introduction to the brand and its philosophy. The Gallery subsection 
has three cards with images and descriptions of the brand's popular products. The cards have a float and box-sizing property to ensure they align 
properly and maintain their size even with borders and padding.
The About section has a background image, a white heading with uppercase letters, and a paragraph describing the brand's background and values. 
The Contact section has an address with uppercase letters, and the footer has a dark blue background color with white text and a copyright notice.
Overall, the website has a professional and modern design that conveys the brand's focus on sustainability and fashion.</p>
